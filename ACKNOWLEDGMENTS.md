### Original Project

**Shikai** began as a modern LightDM WebKit2 greeter theme created by **[TheWisker](https://github.com/TheWisker/Shikai)**.  
This fork builds directly on that foundation, preserving core ideas while modernizing the codebase, UI, and tooling.  
Thanks to TheWisker for the original inspiration and implementation!

## LightDM [[↑][index]]

**Shikai** is a theme for **[LightDM](https://github.com/canonical/lightdm)** — thanks to the upstream project and its community for enabling advanced greeter development.

## Web Greeter Implementations [[↑][index]]

**Shikai** ensures compatibility and draws ideas from modern web-based greeters:

- **[Web Greeter](https://github.com/JezerM/web-greeter)**
- **[Nody Greeter](https://github.com/JezerM/nody-greeter)** (Node.js/Electron-based alternative)
- **[Sea Greeter](https://github.com/JezerM/sea-greeter)** (WebKit2GTK experimental variant)

## HTML & CSS [[↑][index]]

Shikai leverages modern web technologies for styling and layout:

- **HTML** and **CSS** (with **Sass** for preprocessing where applicable)
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive, and modern UI components

## JavaScript / TypeScript Ecosystem [[↑][index]]

The project adopts a **TypeScript-first** approach with contemporary libraries:

- **React** for composable UI components
- **Zustand** (with **immer**) for lightweight, immutable state management
- Enhanced accessibility and internationalization (i18n) support

## Build Tooling (Vite, Bun) [[↑][index]]

As of v2.0.0, the entire build system was migrated to:

- **Vite** for fast, modern bundling and development
- **Bun** powering dev/release workflows for superior performance and ergonomics
